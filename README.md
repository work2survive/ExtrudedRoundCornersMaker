# Extruded Round Corners Maker

**A native 3D/2.5D Extruded Rounded Rectangle Generator & Animator for Adobe After Effects.**

Built as a high-performance alternative to Cinema 4D / Ray-Traced rendering, **Extruded Round Corners Maker** generates mathematically precise 3D rounded rectangles using native 2D segment strips (strictly the needed segment count per 90° corner arc) and independent corner radii. 

Everything is driven by live After Effects expressions parented to a single **Master Controller**, allowing full real-time animation directly on the timeline.

Compatible with **Classic 3D** and **Advanced 3D** (AE 2024+).

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Pure Classic & Advanced 3D Support
- Works in **Classic 3D**, **Advanced 3D** (AE 2024+), and **Cinema 4D** renderers.
- Screen composition masking is encapsulated inside a self-contained 2D pre-comp wrapper, preventing 3D track-matte breaking in the Advanced 3D engine.
- Renders instantly in real-time, fully compatible with standard AE Cameras and Lights.

### 2. Independent Corner Control & "Link All 4 Corners"
- **Link All 4 Corners (Checkbox)**: When active, all 4 corners automatically take their radius directly from **Radius Top-Left**. You only need to keyframe one slider to animate all corners together!
- **Independent Mode**: When unchecked, dial in separate radii for **Top-Left**, **Top-Right**, **Bottom-Right**, and **Bottom-Left**.
- Built-in proportional clamping ensures corners never self-intersect or invert even if radii exceed the rectangle dimensions.

### 3. Strictly Needed Segments (Zero Bloat, Zero Spiraling)
- The rig generates **strictly the needed number of 2D strips** selected in the UI (e.g. 8, 10, or 12 segments per corner).
- No excess hidden layers, no timeline clutter, and no over-rotation/spiraling.

### 4. Full Extrusion & Depth Control
- **Extruded (Checkbox)**: Instantly switch between a flat 2D custom rounded rectangle and a full 3D extrusion.
- **Extrusion Depth**: Control the depth along the Z-axis. Positive values extrude forward; negative values extrude backward. Keyframeable directly on the timeline!

### 5. Precision Seam & Anti-Clipping Math
- **Anti-Gap Seam Overlap**: Sub-pixel seam overlap (+0.5px) completely eliminates 3D antialiasing edge gaps.
- **Cap Z-Offset (Anti Z-Fighting)**: Offsets cap layers by 0.1px from wall edges, eliminating GPU flickering and coplanar clipping.

### 6. Timeline & Expression Animatable Colors
- Dedicated controls on the Master Controller for:
  - **Cap Top Color**
  - **Cap Bottom Color**
  - **Edge Color**
- Keyframe colors directly on the timeline to create smooth lighting transitions or dynamic palette shifts.
- **Cylindrical Shading Intensity**: Simulates realistic ambient light curvature around the rounded corners even without 3D scene lights.

### 7. Cap as Screen (Composition Playback & Mapping)
- Play and reproduce any composition, footage, or video on the **Top Cap**, **Bottom Cap**, or **Both Caps** (shared or separate comps).
- **Universal 2D Mounted Wrapper**: Operates seamlessly in both Classic 3D and Advanced 3D.
- **9 Alignment Presets**: Center, Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right, Center-Left, Center-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, Bottom-Right.
- **Scale Modes**:
  - `Auto Fit (Inside)`: Automatically fits the comp within cap bounds preserving aspect ratio.
  - `Auto Fill (Cover)`: Fills the entire cap area, cropping excess.
  - `Stretch`: Stretches to match exact Width & Height.
  - `Manual Scale (%)`: Direct slider control.
- **X / Y Offset**: Fine-tune screen positioning in pixels. Both Scale and Offset are keyframeable on the timeline!
